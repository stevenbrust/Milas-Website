            <h2>Memorable Moments</h2>
            <p>Let me share some memorable moments I've had with Mila! 
                Teaching her to go say hello to people was both funny and adorable. 
                She used to be so protective, but she's been gradually improving. 
                Watching her try to run and jump into my arms is the cutest thing, even though she hasn't quite mastered the height yet. 
                Instead of jumping high, she throws herself sideways at me, which always brings a smile to my face. 
                Another hilarious moment is when I try to dress her up in clothes and outfits. Mila freezes and refuses to move, as if she's saying, "No way, I'm not budging!" 
                It's a riot to see her strike those frozen poses. These moments with Mila are truly priceless, 
                filled with laughter, love, and the unique quirks that make her so special to me.</p>
